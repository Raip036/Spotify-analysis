Data cleaning: Handle missing values, correct date-time formats, and remove unnecessary columns.
Insights generation:
Total listening time per song
Most frequently played songs
Listening patterns by day of the week and hour
Visualization: Create interactive charts using Python libraries.
Dashboard: Optional Streamlit dashboard for dynamic exploration of streaming data.
Technologies & Tools
Python 3.11+
pandas â€” data cleaning and aggregation
numpy â€” numerical operations
matplotlib / seaborn â€” visualizations
Streamlit â€” interactive dashboard
PostgreSQL (optional) â€” storing cleaned datasets
Git & GitHub â€” version control and project hosting
